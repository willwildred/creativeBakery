# Creative Bakery Landing
This landing about... cookies!!!
<br>
I love this landing, but I decided to add some new styles and effects, I hope it's not too much ;)
<br>
What I used here: SASS, SCSS, Stylelint, GRID, BEM, npm, Flexbox.
You can run my project local, for this: you need to install node version v14.21, than install all packages via npm i, and run project with npm run start.
